<center><h1><strong>What is HotMugg?</strong></h1></center>
<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">Our mission is to provide discerning coffee patrons with a tool to find local independent coffee shops that deliver all the amenities and services of a generic coffee shop franchise while still providing and authentic individualized artisan experience.

HotMugg is a project started by two brothers who became bored with the monotony of generic overpriced coffeeshops dominating the world coffee market.  What started as a hypothetical conversation soon evolved into a very serious effort to build a platform to unite lovers of independent coffee shops with the most characterful coffee dens hidden in every local neighborhood across the world.   As work went on, it became clear to Henry and William (the founders) that not only was this project full of potential, but that it was also very feasible.</p>

<center><h1><strong>How HotMugg works</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">The reason that global coffee chains are so successful is that they are a known quantity.  With the brand name comes a promise of a comfortable place to relax, quality Internet, consistent coffee and quick service.  For millions of commuters, students, business people and families the independent coffeeshops is too unknown and too risky.  What HotMugg aims to do is to build a sort of guarantee for independents to certify to customers that it also offers good value coffee, quick service, comfortable spaces and all other amenities.

We are inspired by the Fair Trade label a label only given to products that operate within strict parameters so that customers can buy with confidence.  Why have developed a graphic that will be displayed by coffeeshops that comply with HotMugg requirements.  We will also have a website and app so that patrons can find locally owned coffeeshops from their computers or on the go.

HotMugg will charge coffeeshops a small fee to be registered to our website and app and be required to display a small adhesive sticker on their window or door to signify that they are a verified independent coffee shop meeting HotMugg’s criteria.  This fee will be to cover the costs of the HotMugg business and later proceeds will be spent on advertising our platform to other potential patrons.</p>

<center><h1><strong>Who We Are</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">We are two brothers both born in NYC and both very keen on coffee culture and local businesses.  Henry is a junior in high school and is responsible for the technological aspect of HotMugg.  He has developed the website and app himself.  William is 20 and studies at university in England.  He helps with the marketing and logistical side of HotMugg and will eventually hope to promote HotMugg through European cities.
Though we are only a team of two we are both very motivated and optimistic about this project.  As it has continued HotMugg has gathered enough interest and momentum that we no longer have the resources to fund it to its full potential.</p>
&nbsp
<center><h1><strong>Why New York?</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">New York City has been chosen as the first location for HotMugg.  NYC has more Starbucks per square foot than anywhere else in the world and New York seems more than any other city to run on quick efficient coffee.  There is also a vibrant independent coffee shop culture in the city and a healthy appreciation for local characterful businesses.  Once HotMugg has achieved success in the New York market, we will look to expand to other metropolitan cities.</p>
&nbsp
<center><h1><strong>What We Have So Far</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">So far, our website is well on the way to completion with locations across New York City already programmed and ready.  We’re using a variation of Google Maps available to programmers like us to link website users to the coffeeshops nearest them.  Our mobile app is also under development with the IOS version near completion for New Yorkers.</p>
&nbsp
<center><h1><strong>Our intentions and expenses</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">We decided to set our project goal as $1000 because this will allow us to purchase a minimum order of financially viable project rewards. About 40% of the money raised will go back out to the backers in the form of subscriptions to Bean of the Month, and HotMugg merchandise. The money left over will be put into purchasing web hosting for the website as well as our database of locations. The money will also go towards: application development on Android and iOS platforms (more software platforms will follow), adding more HotMugg locations, and website development and maintenance.</p>
&nbsp
<center><h1><strong>Why this project deserves support</strong></h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">Supporting local businesses instead of chains is a noble cause and one we believe in.  Firstly, on an economic level, it means that the money we spend on a cup of coffee stays local with the owner of the shop instead of going to executives and corporate headquarters, often located in other cities or even countries.  Secondly, it maintains the individual fabric of local neighborhoods and communities, and thirdly, it provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to found their own unique business and enables them to compete with corporations</p>
&nbsp
<center><h1><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong><h1></center>

<p style="font-size: 110%; font-family: Myriad;">The biggest challenge we face is funding the initial payments to legally register our business and to pay for our website fees.   We are encouraged that these fees are relatively small for a start up business and that we can operate under a low overhead.  Once we have funded our project our next challenge will be to grow public awareness of our brand and to achieve the scale it needs to to be viable.</p>
